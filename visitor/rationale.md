A `visitor` is a component that can traverse a data structure of possibly related types.

### The visitor pattern becomes useful when:

- Need to define a new operation on an entire class hierarchy

- Do not want to modify every class in the hierarchy

- Need access to non-common aspects of the classes in the hierarchy

- Create an external component to handle rendering without explicit type checks
